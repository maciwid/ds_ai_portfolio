# Maciej Widłak — Data Scientist

## About me

I’m a data scientist with a background in cognitive science and computer science. I use data to move beyond surface-level patterns toward interpretable insights that help make sense of complex systems. I’m also interested in creatively applying existing models to build practical applications that support everyday tasks, research, and idea consolidation.
